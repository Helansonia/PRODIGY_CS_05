Network Packet Sniffer in Python using Scapy

In today’s digital world, network security plays a crucial role in protecting data from cyber threats. To deepen my understanding of network analysis and cybersecurity, I built a Packet Sniffer using Python and Scapy. This tool captures real-time network packets, analyzes key details such as source & destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data, and helps in traffic monitoring and security analysis.

🔍 Why is Packet Sniffing Important?
Packet sniffing allows security professionals to:
✔ Monitor network traffic for unusual activities
✔ Detect intrusions and prevent unauthorized access
✔ Analyze protocols to understand how data moves across networks
✔ Debug network issues by inspecting raw data packets

💡 Features of the Packet Sniffer:
✅ Real-time packet capturing for live monitoring
✅ Protocol identification (TCP, UDP, etc.)
✅ Payload analysis to inspect transmitted data
✅ Command-line interface for ease of use
✅ Error handling to manage permissions & unexpected failures

📌 Key Learnings from the Project:
✔ How network packets are structured and transmitted
✔ How different protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) function
✔ How intrusion detection and network monitoring work
✔ How to handle low-level network interactions using Python

🔗 What's Next?
This project has been an exciting step toward exploring ethical hacking, network security, and penetration testing. Next, I plan to implement packet filtering, logging, and traffic visualization to enhance its capabilities.

This tool is designed for educational and ethical use, helping cybersecurity enthusiasts and network analysts understand packet structures and network behavior.
